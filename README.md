Project Description: Laravel and React CRUD Application
This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application developed using the Laravel PHP framework for the backend and React for the frontend. To set up and run the project, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites:
Ensure that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your system.
Composer, the PHP dependency manager, should also be installed.

1. Install Dependencies:

* For JavaScript dependencies (React):
    npm install

* For PHP dependencies (Laravel):
    composer update

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Running the Project:

* Start Laravel Server:
    Run the following command in one console: php artisan serve
    Now access the provided URL in your browser.

3. Start React Development Server:
    Open another console and run: npm run dev
    This command compiles and bundles the React code. Ensure that the Laravel server is still running.

Now, you should be able to interact with the Laravel and React CRUD application. The Laravel server handles backend logic, while React manages the frontend. Make sure to follow these steps whenever you want to run the project locally.

Feel free to explore the CRUD functionalities, create, read, update, and delete tasks as needed.
